# Building a SOC + Honeynet in Azure (Live Traffic)

## Introduction

In this project, I designed a mini honeynet within Azure to monitor and analyze potential threats. Various log sources from connected resources were ingested into a Log Analytics workspace, which was integrated with Microsoft Sentinel to generate attack maps, trigger alerts, and create incidents. To evaluate the effectiveness of security measures, I first recorded baseline metrics in an unprotected environment over a 24-hour period. Next, I implemented security controls to harden the environment and conducted another 24-hour monitoring phase to compare results. The key metrics analyzed include:

SecurityEvent: Windows Event Logs

Syslog: Linux Event Logs

SecurityAlert: Alerts triggered in Log Analytics

SecurityIncident: Incidents created in Microsoft Sentinel

AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL: Malicious network flows allowed into the honeynet

The Azure-based mini honeynet is structured with the following key components:

Virtual Machines: Two Windows VMs and one Linux VM serving as the honeypots.

Virtual Network (VNet): Provides network connectivity for all deployed resources.

Network Security Group (NSG): Controls inbound and outbound traffic to the virtual network.

Log Analytics Workspace: Central hub for aggregating and analyzing log data.

Microsoft Sentinel: Integrated with the workspace for threat detection, alerting, and incident management.

Azure Storage Account: Used for storing logs and other critical data.

Azure Key Vault: Secures sensitive information such as access keys and secrets.


BEFORE Metrics:
In the initial setup, all resources were deployed with unrestricted exposure to the internet. Virtual Machines had their Network Security Groups (NSGs) configured to allow all traffic, and built-in firewalls were left completely open. Additionally, other resources were accessible via public endpoints, with no implementation of Private Endpoints for security.

AFTER Metrics:
Following security enhancements, the Network Security Groups (NSGs) were reconfigured to block all traffic except from the designated admin workstation. Built-in firewalls were enabled and configured for all resources, and Private Endpoints were utilized to restrict access and secure the environment.

## Metrics Before Hardening / Security Controls

The following table shows the metrics we measured in our insecure environment for 24 hours:
Start Time 2023-08-13 16:05:29
Stop Time 2023-08-14 16:05:29

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 18965
| Syslog                   | 3115
| SecurityAlert            | 12
| SecurityIncident         | 340
| AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | 825

## Attack Maps Before Hardening / Security Controls

```All map queries actually returned no results due to no instances of malicious activity for the 24 hour period after hardening.```

## Metrics After Hardening / Security Controls

The following table shows the metrics we measured in our environment for another 24 hours, but after we have applied security controls:
Start Time 2023-08-17 13:27
Stop Time	2023-08-18 13:27

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 8820
| Syslog                   | 30
| SecurityAlert            | 0
| SecurityIncident         | 0
| AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | 0

## Conclusion

In this project, a mini honeynet was deployed in Microsoft Azure, with log sources configured to feed into a Log Analytics workspace. Microsoft Sentinel was utilized to monitor the environment, triggering alerts and creating incidents based on the ingested logs. Metrics were collected during an initial 24-hour period in an unprotected setup and compared to those gathered after implementing security controls. The results showed a significant reduction in security events and incidents, highlighting the effectiveness of the applied measures.

Itâ€™s important to note that if the network resources were subjected to higher user activity, the volume of security events and alerts within the 24-hour post-hardening phase might have been greater.
